## Installer

I use MS ClickOnce for installation and updates.

An installer with the current version is hosted [here](https://marcdrexler.blob.core.windows.net/bulkeditor/BulkEditor.application)

Updates are automatically checked for each start.

Because the package is not signed with a public certificate, you might see some security warnings when installing and starting the app if you are using Windows 7 or later.
